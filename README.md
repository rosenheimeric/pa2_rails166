This code was suplemented by the RORT reading which proved very helpful for the app design. The bootstrap website also did a lot of the work for me. 
What I struggled with was the implimentation of functions inside HTML code, which required some HTML learning. Definitely still some formatting issues with the data but for the data does appear in the browser.
